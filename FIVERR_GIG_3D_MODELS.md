## REQUIREMENTS FROM BUYER

Please provide:
1. **Description** of what you need (be as detailed as possible)
2. **Approximate dimensions** (mm or inches)
3. **Intended use** (functional part, decoration, prototype, etc.)
4. **Reference images** (if available - helps immensely!)

## FAQ

**Q: What is OpenSCAD and why use it?**
A: OpenSCAD is a parametric 3D modeling tool that uses code instead of clicking. This makes models easy to modify - just change a number to adjust dimensions. Perfect for 3D printing!

**Q: Can I modify the model after delivery?**
A: Yes! I provide the full OpenSCAD source code with clear parameter documentation. Change dimensions, add features, or customize as needed.

**Q: Will this work with my 3D printer?**
A: Yes! All models are exported as STL files which work with any 3D printer. I provide recommended print settings for best results.

**Q: What if the model doesn't print correctly?**
A: All models are designed with 3D printing in mind (proper wall thickness, overhangs, support, etc.). If you encounter issues, I'll help troubleshoot or adjust the model.

**Q: Can you create models from sketches or photos?**
A: Yes! Reference images are very helpful. For Standard and Premium packages, I can work from sketches, photos, or detailed descriptions.

**Q: Do you create organic/artistic models?**
A: OpenSCAD is best for geometric, parametric, and functional designs. For organic shapes (like characters or sculptures), other tools may be better suited.

**Q: What's the size limit?**
A: No size limit on the model itself. I design to your specifications. Just ensure your 3D printer can handle the final dimensions.

**Q: Can you create multi-part assemblies?**
A: Yes! Premium package includes assemblies with multiple parts that fit together.

**Q: How quickly can you deliver?**
A: Simple templates: 30 minutes to 1 day. Custom models: 1-2 days. Complex parametric: 2-3 days. Rush delivery available.

**Q: Do you provide commercial license?**
A: Yes! All models come with commercial use rights. Print and sell as many as you want.
