## 🔧 CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED

### 1. Gemini API Model Update (CRITICAL)
**Issue:** AI Assistant, CAD Generation, Memory Search returning 404 errors
**Root Cause:** Using deprecated `gemini-1.5-pro` model
**Fix:** Updated to `gemini-2.5-flash` in 3 locations
**Impact:** All AI features now functional
**File:** `command_center.py` lines 403, 769, 995

### 2. Path Traversal Security (CRITICAL)
**Issue:** Insufficient filename sanitization in STL compilation
**Risk:** Malicious users could access arbitrary files via `../../../`
**Fix:** Multi-layer protection:
  - Strict character whitelist (alphanumeric + underscore/hyphen)
  - Explicit traversal sequence rejection
  - Length limits (100 chars max)
  - Path verification (must be in CAD output dir)
**Impact:** Security hardened, vulnerability eliminated
**File:** `command_center.py` compile_scad_to_stl function

### 3. OpenSCAD Security Warnings (RESOLVED)
**Issue:** macOS Gatekeeper blocking OpenSCAD-2021.01 repeatedly
**Root Cause:** Broken symlink, improper installation, quarantine attributes
**Fix:**
  - Uninstalled broken version
  - Reinstalled via Homebrew
  - Removed quarantine attributes (`xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine`)
**Impact:** No more security warnings, OpenSCAD execution verified
**Testing:** STL generation working perfectly
