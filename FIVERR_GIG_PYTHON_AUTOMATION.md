## FAQ

**Q: What automation tasks can you handle?**
A: Web scraping, form filling, LinkedIn automation, job applications, data processing, file management, email automation, price monitoring, report generation, and more. If it's repetitive, I can automate it!

**Q: Will the script work on my computer?**
A: Yes! All scripts are cross-platform (Windows, Mac, Linux). I provide detailed setup instructions and can help troubleshoot if needed.

**Q: Do I need programming experience to use the script?**
A: No! I provide simple configuration files and clear documentation. Just change settings in a config file and run the script.

**Q: What if the script breaks or stops working?**
A: All scripts include error handling and logging. I provide 30 days of free support for bug fixes. If a website changes, I can update the script for a small fee.

**Q: Is this legal/safe?**
A: All scripts follow best practices for ethical automation. For web scraping, I implement rate limiting and respect robots.txt. For LinkedIn/job sites, I use safe delays to avoid detection. You're responsible for ensuring your use complies with each platform's terms of service.

**Q: Can you automate LinkedIn without getting my account banned?**
A: Yes! I use realistic delays, human-like behavior, and safe daily limits (50 connections/day max). However, automation always carries some risk - use responsibly.

**Q: Will you need my passwords?**
A: For testing, I may need temporary access. I recommend creating a test account or changing your password after delivery. I NEVER store credentials.

**Q: Can the script run automatically on a schedule?**
A: Yes! I can set it up to run daily/hourly using cron (Mac/Linux) or Task Scheduler (Windows). Cloud scheduling (Heroku, AWS) available in Premium package.

**Q: What if I need changes after delivery?**
A: Minor changes are included in revisions. For major feature additions, I offer a discounted rate for existing clients ($50/hour).

**Q: Do you provide source code?**
A: Yes! You get the full Python source code with comments. You own it completely and can modify as needed.
